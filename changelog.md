## Unreleased
=======
## Unrealeased
>>>>>>> 01e74bd7b10cc8b8c9b538cb47bbe41c67065553
### Added
 - expanding logging functionality to the Reporter Generator; now outputs a calculation log with each data evaluation

## [0.6.0] 2020-5-8
### Added
  - Concentration Calculator tool
  - more robust error handling and reporting during experiment loop
  - added 'Reading Interval' to 'Test Settings' -- sets interval between measurements
    (default is one reading per three seconds)
### Fixed
  - Report Generator now properly inserts results as number values, not text
### Changed
  - moved the Report Generator's math into its own file
  - updated the Report Generator's math to acknowledge the reading interval when calculating results
  - internal code review and formatting
### Removed
  - Winsound dependency (allows to run cross-platform)
### Notes
  - Reading Interval added to maintain consistency in data structure across computers; lower-end hardware seems unable to faithfully record one reading per second, leading to scoring inconsistencies between equipment systems
