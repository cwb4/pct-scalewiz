### Changed
 - improved UI theme and its consistency across OS environments
### Fixed

## [0.7.3] 2020-6-5
### Changed
 - the device manager is now better equipped to handle more than 2 devices at a given time, and won't allow attempting to connect to the same pump twice
 - device port options are now offered through a dropdown box so the user doesn't have to type them, and has no opportunity to type them incorrectly
 - improvements to UI layout (text spacing, etc.)
 - improved calculations log title to be more meaningful, and only keep one log per project
 - improved UI consistency across Windows and Linux environments
 - ensured file paths are handled consistently across operating systems
 - improvements to code quality and organization

## [0.7.2]  2020-6-2
### Added
 - small module for sending commands to the pumps individually (start, stop, change flowrate, etc)
### Changed
 - Application font is now Arial across operating systems (visually consistent UI)
 - optimized the experiment loop timer to be more reliable and reduced CPU consumption by ~80% (!!!)

## [0.7.1] 2020-5-29
### Added
 - user input validation for concentration calculator; only accepts numeric input
### Changed
 - 'Color cycle' label in settings menu is now a hyperlink to a list of valid color names
 - added file dialog prompt to settings fields for file/folder paths so the user doesn't have to type file paths in manually
 - selecting pump to plot from MainWindow uses a combobox instead of radiobuttons
### Removed
 - removed the unused toolbar from the main window's plot

## [0.7.0] 2020-5-28
### Added
 - purchased custom application icon (with appropriate license)
 - support for having more than two pumps connected to the same device
### Changed
 - refactored the settings menu to a simpler user interface with input validation
 - refactored the report generator to a simpler user interface with input validation
 - calculations log is more explicit and states formula used for each calculation step
### Fixed
 - bug causing script to crash if neither pump is connected to computer when program starts
### Removed
 - support for plot styles other than the default (color sequence may still be changed)


## [0.6.3] 2020-5-19
### Added
 - full support for Linux cross compatibility implemented
 - additional error handling while test is running
### Changed
 - minor improvements to calculations log
### Removed
 - support for plot style options (can only change series colors)
 -   
## [0.6.2] 2020-5-18
### Added
 - can no longer (accidentally) close the program while a test is running
 - more convenient keybindings to main menu (hitting enter in an input field moves to next field, or starts test after the last field)
 - completing a test gives a brief summary of the that trial's data
### Changed
 - calculaion steps in the calc logs are now more verbose and are easier to follow
 - GUI improvements such as bolding important text in main menu and dosage calculator
 - style options for plot generation are now hidden by default
### Removed
 - removed the "Time Limit" and "Fail PSI" fields from main menu (had no use as those settings are managed by the settings menu and don't often change)
### Fixed
 - improved the experiment loop timer to be _much_ less susceptible to drift, even on lower end hardware
 - fixed a bug that prevented data from being recorded if any errors occurred while talking with the pumps
 - fixed a bug where empty cells in the csv file were sometimes counted as measurements (due to how Excel handles csv files with empty values)
 - fixed a bug causing some numerical data to be exported to report as text values

## [0.6.1] 2020-5-11
### Added
 - expand logging functionality in the the Reporter Generator to output a calculation log with each data evaluation
 - experiment handler can dynamically adjust reading interval to better compensate for slow system time and help maintain accuracy
### Fixed
 - better handling of row sizes when exporting reports (row width scales with number of trials)
 - improved header information auto-fill
### Changed
 - internal code review / quality assurance

## [0.6.0] 2020-5-8
### Added
  - Concentration Calculator tool
  - more robust error handling and reporting during experiment loop
  - added 'Reading Interval' to 'Test Settings' -- sets interval between measurements
    (default is one reading per three seconds)
### Fixed
  - Report Generator now properly inserts results as number values, not text
### Changed
  - moved the Report Generator's math into its own file
  - updated the Report Generator's math to acknowledge the reading interval when calculating results
  - internal code review and formatting
### Removed
  - Winsound dependency (allows to run cross-platform)
### Notes
  - Reading Interval added to maintain consistency in data structure across computers; lower-end hardware seems unable to faithfully record one reading per second, leading to scoring inconsistencies between equipment systems


## [0.5.3] 2020-5-4
### Added
 - info/error messageboxes to guide user while using Report Generator
 - a 'Help' option on the Report Generator menu
 - a 'Help' option on the main window menu

### Changed
 - the main window's menu is now flat; no more nested controls
### Removed
 - removed unused 'date format' from settings
