## Roadmap
Basic Matplotlib styles support for the plotting utility is the most recently
added feature.
Planned features include

  * greater customization options for the plotting utility
    such as allowing the user to define figure size and adding support for more matplotlib styles
  * simple utility to read/write generic messages to/from the pumps
  * configuration file support to remember useful information
    such as last used project directory, plot style templates, etc.
